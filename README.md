# course_registration_system
This is a class project that implements basic functions of a course registration system. It will read from the MyUniversityCoursesFile.csv if the program is run out for the first time, and will serialize user's data every time the user is logged out. The updated, serialized data will be read next time the program is run.
There will be two types of user in the system: admin and student. Admin has exclusive access to some functions.
